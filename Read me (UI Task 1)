Hello I'm Mostafa Alsaddek 
-------------
-------------
In this project, I use Eclipse, Java, Cucumber, and JUnit runner.
I develop this framework in Page Object Model

I make 2 scenarios
1- Login
I implement 4 TCs like to show different messages per each case of inputs.

2- Purchase Items
	- I Login to the home page
	- I filter the products
	- I select some of them 
	- I save the names and prices to use them in assertion later
	- I complete the purchase cycle
	- I log out

You can get the feature file in (src/test/java/features/SauceDemo.feature)
	
I make a static wait of 3 seconds in the last step of each scenario before closing the window to notice the end of each scenario.

I create a configuration file that contains the website URL and the Driver location for Chrome and firefox, my code select the driver based on Driver value here.

As this is a POM, I create a class for each page of the application
each class contain the page elements and the action on these elements, so I can use them in test cases
You can find them in pages package (src/main/java/pages) 

As this is a Cucumber I create the step definition file in sdFiles package (src/main/java/sdFiles) that contains the actions for each command in the feature file.

I use a local report after each run in HTML, you can find the test report in (target\cucumber-reports\cucumber-html-report.html)
========================================================================

To run this application you need to import the project to Eclipse then Go to the Runner file (src/test/java/runner/RunnerFile.java) then run as "JUnit Test"
-------------------------------
I attach "chromedriver" and "geckodriver" to this project in resources package (src/test/java/resources)
-------------------------------
Note: I use Windows and Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version: 2024-09 (4.33.0)
